# LLM SEO—A Beginner's View on the Journey Ahead

Hello everyone!

This is my first ever blog which i'm writing today and I wanted to talk about something that's shaping how we all use the internet how Large Language Models (LLMs) are changing SEO.  
If you're new to this topic like me, let's figure out together what **LLM SEO** means, why it matters, and how it's changing the way we search online.

## What is LLM SEO?

**LLM SEO** (Large Language Model Search Engine Optimization) is about making your website and content easy for AI models like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and others to find, understand, and use while answering people's questions.

In traditional SEO, the goal was simple: rank #1 on Google for the right keywords.  
With LLM SEO, the goal is different it's about becoming the *answer* that AI picks, summarizes, and shares directly with users.

## How is LLM SEO Different from Old-School SEO?

| Traditional SEO        | LLM SEO                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Stuff keywords         | Build deep, connected content           |
| Chase backlinks        | Write natural, clear explanations       |
| Rank for blue links    | Get cited by AIs in direct answers      |
| Focus on search rank   | Focus on helpfulness and context        |

So instead of stuffing keywords or chasing backlinks, LLM SEO is about writing naturally, answering real questions, and helping AI understand what your content truly means.

## Why is Everyone Talking About LLM SEO?

- AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, and Perplexity now give **direct answers** not just lists of links.  
- Your content needs to be clear and trustworthy so AI can **cite it** in those answers.  
- Helpful, original, and easy to understand content now beats old SEO tricks.  
- "Expertise" and "helpfulness" are what matter most.

Basically — **quality > quantity**.

## How is the Journey Changing?

- **Keywords → Context:** LLMs value clear and meaningful content, not just repeated keywords.  
- **Page rank → Cited answers:** The new "#1 spot" is being mentioned by AI as a trusted source.  
- **One search → Everywhere:** LLM SEO affects not only Google but also voice assistants, chatbots, and even product search.

## Quick Best Practices for LLM SEO

- Write about what your audience actually cares about  
- Add Q&A or FAQ sections with real questions  
- Use schema markup: `[FAQ]`, `[Product]`, `[HowTo]`, etc.  
- Keep your website fast, clean, and easy to navigate  
- Start with clear answers, key points, and comparison tables  
- Encourage honest user reviews — AIs love genuine feedback
