## How I Got Started

Hello Everyone,

This is my second blog I'm writing today to share my experience of hacktoberfest 2025. I had taken part earlier as well in 2023 in which i had completed all the PRs like this time around. I have taken part in 2024 as well but I wasn't active during that time.

First time I knew about hacktoberfest through Twitter currently known as X. I was excited and took part into it.
Let me share you my journey of this time around.

## My Goals for the Event

This time I wanted to let students know about hacktoberfest so :
- I hosted an event Hacktoberfest@BVM
- Let students explore the open source contributions
- Along them complete my PR's
- Make sure that most of the students from my college learn about open source.

## First Steps

This time I wanted to let students know about what is Hacktoberfest ? How they can contribute to real world projects ?

I reached out to my Faculty Coordinators and HOD sir regarding it and I got permission from them and I started working towards it. I am lead organizer of Google Developers On Campus BVM and Free & Open Source Software and Tools Club.

I had two big one month long mega events one is Google Cloud Study Jams from Google and Second is college level hacktoberfest.

My Goal is that students learn about the current trending things. Textbooks and Syllabus is not enought in this Age Of AI Era.

## Challeges I Faced

We had event kick off on 1st Oct but We had massbunks, exams, Navratri last day..etc. I was worried that people will show up or not but luckily out of 146 people 71 people arrived on our event kick off and On that day we started with Git & Github for Hacktoberfest 2025 Workshop.

In that our speaker jay sir tought students how they can use Git and Github.

It was new club under me and no one else besides me knew about it. I was managing all things on my own while handeling my second event as well. My sole goal was that students learn from it.

We had mid exams and then diwali vacations so many students were not able to be part of it after registration.

But We believe in Quality --> Quantity.

Those who took part they all learned how real world competition is. Today is last day and I'm looking forward to 2026 on how they will do it next year.

## Community & Collaboration

Many students from our college made friends from community. I wasn't able to do that this time around because I was focusing on my both events that i wasn't able to do much this time around.

But I made lot of friends during 2023 and I'm still in touch with them.

## Wins, Struggles, and Lessons Learned

- Biggest win: Students from our college learned Git & Github and how they can contribute to real world projects.
- Biggest struggle: Due to vacation time Student were not able to be part of it for many days and It was kind of vacation vibes so it was hard.
- Lessons: This time only I was handling all things because my team was new but next year i will create a proper structure.

## Why I Recommend Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest made open source less intimidating and more fun. You can contribute to real world projects and at a same time you can make a lot of friends.

Swags are extra on top of this.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

I plan to keep contributing, join more events from now on and as I have mentioned my goal is to make sure that students keep their self updated with the changes.
