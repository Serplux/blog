**Updated on:** 19 September 2025

Every October, the global tech community comes together to celebrate Hacktoberfest — a month-long open-source festival that inspires thousands of people to contribute to projects they care about.

Hacktoberfest 2025 is here, and this year, Serplux is joining the celebration — and inviting you to join us too.

Whether you're an experienced developer or someone who’s never contributed to open source before, this is your chance to learn, build, give back, and win exclusive rewards along the way.

## What Is Hacktoberfest?

[Hacktoberfest 2025](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is an annual open-source initiative first launched by DigitalOcean. The idea is simple yet powerful: anyone, anywhere in the world, can participate by contributing to open-source projects throughout the month of October.

Here’s what makes it special:

- It’s open to everyone — developers, designers, writers, marketers, students, hobbyists, and professionals alike.

- It encourages meaningful contributions that improve real-world projects.

- It comes with awesome rewards for those who complete the challenge.

The goal isn’t just to win swag. It’s to learn, grow your skills, build your GitHub portfolio, and support open-source communities that power the internet.

## Why Participate Through Serplux?

At [Serplux](https://serplux.com/), we believe that open source is for everyone — and Hacktoberfest is the perfect moment to start your journey.

We’re opening up our own projects to contributors this October, and offering you a fun, supportive space to learn, collaborate, and get your work noticed.

Here’s what makes contributing through Serplux special:

- Hands-on experience with real projects

If you’ve ever thought “I want to contribute to open source but don’t know where to start,” this is it. We’ll guide you through every step.

## How to Participate (Step-by-Step Guide)

Getting started is simple. Just follow these steps:

### Step 1 — Register for Hacktoberfest

Visit the [Hacktoberfest official site](https://hacktoberfest.com/) and sign up with your GitHub or GitLab account. This ensures your contributions are tracked.

### Step 2 — Choose a Serplux Project

We’ll soon open our Serplux open-source repositories for contributions.
These projects will have issues marked `hacktoberfest` and `good first issue` to help you get started easily.

(📌 We’ll update this page with live repository links soon.)

### Step 3 — Pick an Issue and Start Working

Once you find an issue you like:

- Make your changes (bug fixes, new features, documentation, design, etc.)

### Step 4 — Submit a Pull Request (PR)

Go back to the original repository and create a Pull Request with your changes.
Our maintainers will review your PR, suggest any changes if needed, and merge it if it’s accepted.

### Step 5 — Submit the Contribution Form

After you’ve had at least 2 PRs merged successfully, submit this short form with your PR links and your contact information (email and phone number):
