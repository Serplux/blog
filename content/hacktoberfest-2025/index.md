**Updated on:** 19 September 2025

Every October, the global tech community comes together to celebrate Hacktoberfest — a month-long open-source festival that inspires thousands of people to contribute to projects they care about.

Hacktoberfest 2025 is here, and this year, Serplux is joining the celebration — and inviting you to join us too.

Whether you're an experienced developer or someone who’s never contributed to open source before, this is your chance to learn, build, give back, and win exclusive rewards along the way.

## What Is Hacktoberfest?

[Hacktoberfest 2025](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is an annual open-source initiative first launched by DigitalOcean. The idea is simple yet powerful: anyone, anywhere in the world, can participate by contributing to open-source projects throughout the month of October.

Here’s what makes it special:

- It’s open to everyone — developers, designers, writers, marketers, students, hobbyists, and professionals alike.

- It encourages meaningful contributions that improve real-world projects.

- It comes with awesome rewards for those who complete the challenge.

The goal isn’t just to win swag. It’s to learn, grow your skills, build your GitHub portfolio, and support open-source communities that power the internet.

## Why Participate Through Serplux?

At [Serplux](https://serplux.com/), we believe that open source is for everyone — and Hacktoberfest is the perfect moment to start your journey.
